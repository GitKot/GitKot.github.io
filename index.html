			<h1>A few words about me.</h1>
			<h1>And how exactly I came to web development.</h1>
			<div> 
					I'm a design engineer. I work in a company specializing in the design and construction of buildings.<br>
					Creating - this is part of my daily life. Every day I make a small contribution to the project, which eventually turns into a real one. And, frankly, I know what a "deadline" is. <br>
					I have always been interested in modern technology and how they work. This led me to learning about web technologies.
					Over time, my interest in IT turned into the desire to <b>work</b> in IT, and I began to study in depth the web development and programming.<br>
					"...<b>study</b> every day - this a challenge to our reality " and i can not disagree with this. Questions and answers to them is a cycle of daily training. For me, learning has become a hobby, and frontend development  has become my direction in professional growth.<br>
					Now I'm looking for the opportunity to become part of the team of web developers and <b> be useful</b> to them.
